Given an integer array of size N. 
For each element in the array, check whether
there exist a smaller element on the next immediate 
position of the array. If such an element exists,
print that element. If there is no smaller element
on the immediate next to the element then print -1.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T 
denoting the number of test cases. T testcases
follow. Each testcase contains 2 lines of input:
The first line contains an integer N, where N is 
the size of array.
The second line contains N integers(elements of the
 array) sperated with spaces.

Output:
For each test case, print the next immediate smaller
elements for each element in the array.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ N ≤ 107
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000

Example:
Input
2
5
4 2 1 5 3
6
5 6 2 3 1 7

Output
2 1 -1 3 -1
-1 2 -1 1 -1 -1
